# Dungeon Crawler
A CLI-based, lightweight, batteries-included, dungeon crawler game with a random event navigation system.
Currently in development.

## Project Description
It is a text-based roguelike RPG where players can experience a whole new atmosphere, complete with randomized maps, events, and loot tables.

Using a randomized event system, players can discover towns, structures, dungeons, and find encounters with people of all walks of life, giving you the illusion of immersion into the world's deep lore. Once players discover new territory, they can now navigate through them, or explore more of the world's ambiance as they encounter diverse tribes and cultures, each with a different stories to share.

Fight monsters, talk to locals, fulfill their plights, and become the world's greatest hero; your story is only yours to tell.

## Planned Features
- Tons of items and equipment to use and choose from
- A diverse skill learning system which could allow you to explore tactical builds to fight monsters.
- A forge and alchemy system which allows you unlock new possibilities for customization
- Plenty of areas to explore, each with their distinct loot and monsters to fight
- Boss lairs and dungeons to flex your strategy and wit in combat
- Enemy encounters that utilize turn based combat with an active time turn order system.
- And much more!
